# Teto
### Image Bot for Twitter
A simple C# Twitter bot that posts an image to Twitter on a timer.

---

# Installation

1. Grab yourself the [latest release](https://github.com/o5k/teto/releases) and unpack it somewhere.
2. Create a folder somewhere, and fill it with images. Remember the folder's path - you'll need it. **Make sure the folder contains only images!** 
3. Run Teto.exe - it will create a config file called `teto.cfg` for you.
4. Fill in the blanks in the config file. You'll need Twitter OAuth tokens, so apply for a developer account if you haven't yet, and create an application for Teto.
5. If all is set up right, you can hit ENTER and the bot will start.
